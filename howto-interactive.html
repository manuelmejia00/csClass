    <h3 id="intro-h3"><a name="first-section"> Introduction</a></h3>
    <p id="intro-p">In this project, I learned how to use JavaScript, which is a scripting language that is used to create programs on webpages. For this project, 
        we used JavaScript along with HTML/CSS to create a website that solved a problem. In my website, I chose to help out people who can't make a choice on 
        where to eat lunch. Overall, the project works by having users select answers for three questions, and then the users hit the submit button to get
        results on where they should eat lunch.</p>

    <h3 id="specifics-h3"><a name="second-section">Code Specifics</a></h3>
    <p id="specifics1-p"> One of the first specific pieces of code that I used was the getElementById function. This function allowed me to grab elements from my HTML file using their id
    and assign them to a variable in my JavaScript file.</p>
    <img src ="images/screenshot1.png" id="firstScreenshot">
    <p id="specifics2-p"> Once I had grabbed all these elements, I proceeded to use my next function: addEventListener. Using addEventListener, I was able to make a 
    "submit" button wait for some input (here it was a click), and then run a function once that input was heard. </p>
    <img src ="images/screenshot2.png" id="secondScreenshot">
    <p id="specifics3-p">Inside of this addEventListener function is where I have most of my logic. I used if/else statements along with conditionals to make a unique
    restaurant recommendation based on the user's answers to the questions. For every recommendation, I used .innerHTML to have the text reflect what the program 
    recommends, and I used .src to change the image on the screen to that of the logo of the recommended restaurant.</p>

    <h3 id="choices-h3"><a name="third-section">Choices</a></h3>
    
    <p id="choices-p"> As for the choices I had to make for this project, there really were not too many. I spent the most amount of time deciding what I wanted
    the possible answers the users could pick, and then finding restaurants to assign to each unique response. I also had to make the choice of how I wanted to organize
    my logic, and I ended up just doing it in a straightforward manner, but I think that I could have been more efficient with my logic.</p>

    <h3 id="understanding-h3"><a name="fourth-section">How has this project changed your connection and understanding of what it means to interact with something?</a></h3>
    <p id="understanding-p">This project has given me a larger appreciation for interaction. After this project, I've learned that that are endless ways for users to
        interact with objects, and there are all kinds of inputs that users can provide. Furthermore, there are also a ton of things that you can do with those inputs
        and interactions, and you can use them to create really powerful and interesting programs.</p>

    <h3 id="next-h3"><a name="fifth-section">What is one thing you would change if you had more time?</a></h3>
    <p id="next-p">If I had more time, I would probably add more questions for the user to answer, along with more restaurant recommendations. Also, I would try to
        make the recommendations more accurate, and possibly even add recommendations based on the user's location.</p>
