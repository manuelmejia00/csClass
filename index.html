    <p id="first-paragraph">My full name is Manuel Arimo Mejia. I like to go by Manny, though. 
        Here's a picture of me sitting on a rock, pointing at a big wave that terrified me.</p>

    <h3 id="second-h3"><em></em><a name="second-section">What have I learned in terms of programming?</a></h3>

    <p id="second-paragraph">I've learned a lot about HTML and CSS. Among other things, I now know how HTML uses tags like "p", "h1", and "body" to create the makeup of a page.

    <p id="third-paragraph"> In this project, I've had to do a lot of self-directed work, using resources like <strong>KhanAcademy</strong> and <strong>w3schools</strong>, and I think that was really benificial for me, because being able to guide myself in my learning is something that should help me later on in life.</p>
