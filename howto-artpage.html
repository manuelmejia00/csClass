    <h3 id="intro-h3"><a name="first-section"> What did you create? How does the project work overall?</a></h3>
    
    <p id="intro-p">In this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to create animations, and made a final product using several JavaScript tools. Overall, the project works by using functions, for loops, conditional statements, and user interaction in order to create an art piece of a skyline that 
        changes into "daytime" or "nighttime" depending on where the user's mouse is.</p>

    
    <h3 id="specifics-h3"><a name="second-section"> What are some specifics of the code and how do those work?</a></h3>
    <p id="specifics-p"> As I mentioned above, I used multiple tools, so here are some examples of what I used. Firstly, I used functions; functions are used to create something that takes
        some input and then returns some output. In the case of this project, I used functions, along with a library called Processing, to draw the several elements of my art piece. For example, 
        I created a function called "drawDayBuildings", and as you can see in the screenshot below, this function draws rectangles and fills them in with different colors. 
        Once I created this function, I was then later able to call it in my conditional statement. Using the if and else keywords, I created a conditional statement that would run one 
        codeblock "if" one thing was true, and "else if" something else was true, then
        it would run a separate codeblock. In my project, if the x position of the user's mouse was greater than 200, then "daytime" would appear, running all the functions
        that create the daytime art. Otherwise, or "else if" the x position of the user's mouse was less than 200, then "nighttime" would show, and the functions that draw
        the nighttime art would run.</p>

    <h3 id="choices-h3"><a name="third-section"> What choices did you have to make and how did you go about making them?</a></h3>
    
    <p id="choices-p"> I had to make several choices regarding what kinds of shapes and functions I would use to draw my art. I also had to make choices on what
    kinds of colors to use. At the end of the day, I tried to just use a variety of shapes, and I ultimately used rectangles, ellipses, and arcs. As for the colors,
    I used an RGB color chart, and created a dark color scheme for "nighttime", and a lighter color scheme that mostly used pastel colors for "daytime".</p>

    <h3 id="learned-h3"><a name="fourth-section"> What is one thing that you learned that you will make sure to remember?</a></h3>
    <p id="learned-p"> I learned that you have to be careful when writing conditional statements, because it's possible to write a 
        conditional that is conflicting. For example, in one of the checkpoints for this project, I wrote an if else statement that was actually true for both
        the "if" segment and the "if else" segment, so my code did not have the outcome that I wanted. So, in the future, I will make sure to write conditional
        statements that work correctly and do not conflict.</p>


    
    <h3 id="steps-h3"><a name="fifth-section"> What are the next steps you would do in order to improve your project if you had infinite time?</a></h3>
    <p id="steps-p"> In order to continue improving my project, I would research different ways to implement user interaction. Perhaps I would be able to figure out how to 
        have the user press a key, and then have that input lead to an animation. Also, if I had infinite time, I would be able to make my animation more complex, 
        and have more pieces to it. Generally, I'd just like to make my animation look more aesthetically pleasing overall.</p>
